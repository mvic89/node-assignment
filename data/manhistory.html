    <h3>History</h3>
    <p> Popular history suggests that the drink originated at the Manhattan Club in New York City in the mid-1870s, where it was invented by Iain Marshall for a banquet hosted by Jennie Jerome (Lady Randolph Churchill, 
        mother of Winston) in honor of presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden. The success of the banquet made the drink fashionable, 
        later prompting several people to request the drink by referring to the name of the club where it originated—"the Manhattan cocktail".
        However, Lady Randolph was in France at the time and pregnant, so the story is likely to be fiction.

        However, there are prior references to various similar cocktail recipes called "Manhattan" and served in the Manhattan area.
        By one account it was invented in the 1860s by a bartender named Black at a bar on Broadway near Houston Street.

        Some of the earliest records of the cocktail can be found in Charlie Paul's American and other Drinks and O.H. Byron's The Modern Bartender's Guide, 
        both written in 1884. Paul describes it containing "three or four drops of angostura bitters, ditto of plain syrup; add half a liqueur glass of vermouth, half wine glassful of Scotch whiskey" and garnished with lemon.[9] Byron describes two versions, one with French vermouth and the other with Italian.
        Another early record of the cocktail can be found in William Schmidt's The Flowing Bowl, published in 1891.
        In it, he details a drink containing 2 dashes of gum (gomme syrup), 2 dashes of bitters, 1 dash of absinthe, 2⁄3 portion of whiskey, and 1⁄3 portion of vermouth.

        The same cocktail appears listed as a "Tennessee Cocktail" in Shake 'em Up! by V. Elliott and P. Strong: "Two parts of whiskey, one part of Italian Vermouth, and a dash of bitters poured over ice and stirred vigorously."
