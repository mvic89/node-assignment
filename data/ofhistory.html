    <h3>History</h3>
    <p> The recipe for the old fashioned dates to the early 1800s, though not by that name. 
        The term "old-fashioned cocktails" dates to 1880, and recipes by that name appear in 
        cocktail books of the late 1880s and 1890s, with Proulx (1888) of Chicago the earliest known.

        An old fashioned was one of the simpler and earlier versions of cocktails, before the development of advanced bartending techniques and recipes in the later part of the 19th century.
        The first documented definition of the word "cocktail" was in response to a reader's letter asking to define the word in the 6 May 1806, issue of The Balance and Columbian Repository in Hudson, New York. 
        In the 13 May 1806, issue, the paper's editor wrote that it was a potent concoction of spirits, bitters, water, and sugar; it was also referred to at the time as a bittered sling.
        J.E. Alexander describes the cocktail similarly in 1833, as he encountered it in New York City, as being rum, gin, or brandy, significant water, bitters, and sugar, though he includes a nutmeg garnish as well.

        By the 1860s, it was common for orange cura√ßao, absinthe, and other liqueurs to be added to the cocktail. As cocktails became more complex, drinkers accustomed to simpler cocktails began to ask bartenders for something akin to the pre-1850s drinks. 
        The original concoction, albeit in different proportions, came back into vogue, and was referred to as "old-fashioned".
        The most popular of the in-vogue "old-fashioned" cocktails were made with whiskey, according to a Chicago barman, quoted in the Chicago Daily Tribune in 1882, with rye being more popular than Bourbon. 
        The recipe he describes is a similar combination of spirits, bitters, water, and sugar of seventy-six years earlier.
